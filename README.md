# Oberlin_Concrete_Company

A website for a concrete business

# Completed

Version 1 - with post routes for each concrete pattern to calculate the user inputs and return the cubic Feet and Cubic Yardage with index.handlebars file

# To-Do for version 1

Add labels for 8 pattern user inputs and restyle with business owner's inputs

# To-Do for version 2

For version 2 would like to expand on express with passport.js for user authentication and adding a database so users can save their calculations to a work order ticket and submit with project description and user information for the business owner to be able to review

-add passport.js and a database for user login and storing user's calculations to create a ticket

-restructure so it always redirects to home route after user input calculation and displays the answer for cubic Feet/Yards, with the ability add to their ticket or do another calculation.

-add a route to see their submited calculations & also has a form to add user info and a description of project and submits the ticket for business owner to be able to see

#Extras

Try to refactor code so it follows Dont Repeat Yourself (DRY)
-8 pattern routes that are similiar in structure for calculating cubic feet/yards
