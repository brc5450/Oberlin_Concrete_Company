# Oberlin_Concrete_Company

A website for a concrete business

# Completed

Testing with the squareslab pattern
The webiste will route to the home page and serve from the public folder
-the homepage uses the main and index.handlebars files
-user can select Square Slab tab and input data into form and submit
-post route to calculate user data for square slab cubic feet and cubic yards
-response will render the answer into the answer box field

# To-Do for version 1

finish the post routes for all eight concrete patterns

#To-Do for version 2
-add passport.js and a database for user login and storing user's calculations to create a ticket

-restructure so it always redirects to home route after user input calculation and displays the answer for cubic Feet/Yards, with the ability add to their ticket or do another calculation.

-add a route to see their submited calculations & also has a form to add user info and a description of project and submits the ticket for business owner to be able to see

#Extras

Try to refactor code so it follows Dont Repeat Yourself (DRY)
-8 pattern routes that are basically the same for calculating cubic feet/yards
